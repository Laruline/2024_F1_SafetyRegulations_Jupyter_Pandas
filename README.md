- **Jupyter Notebook**: (https://github.com/Laruline/2024_F1_SafetyRegulations_Jupyter_Pandas/blob/main/F1_Safety_Regulations_Performance.ipynb)

- **Goal**: Provide a detailed analysis of F1 new regulations impact on safety and car performance over the years from 1990 to 2023.
- **Description**: The dataset contains 10 columns of public sensitive data about F1 car performance and regulations from 1990 to 2023. The project steps include: API connection to kaggle, jupyter notebook connection, data modeling, data analysis, data visualization.
- **Skills**: Data cleaning, data modeling, data processing, data visualizations.
- **Technology**: Jupyter Notebook, Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
- **Results**: New regulations on aerodynamics are the most dangerous, mostly likely to change of behaviour on the car and unexpected side-effects. As such, 100% of fatalities happened on a year with new aerodynamics regulations, even though these changes only account for 44% of new regulations. However, new regulations in general seem to have greatly improved the risk of fatal accidents and with fatalities diminishing steadily over the years and plateauing at 0 for the past 7 years. New regulations on aerodynamics don't seem to have improved car performance before the arrival of DRS, and the continuous increase in car weight  was slowly impacting performance negatively as well. The arrival of DRS transformed the cars' ability to overtake, which averages at 110% more than before DRS. It helped counter the increase in weight. Recent efforts in aerodynamics regulation seem to have taken advantage of DRS and increasing car weight while keeping fatalities at bay, showcasing rapidly increasing ability to overtake.
